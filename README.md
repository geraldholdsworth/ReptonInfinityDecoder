# Repton Infinity Decoder
Decompiler, detokeniser, tokeniser and compiler for Repton Infinity 'O', 'eO', 'T' and 'eT' files.<br>
<br>
This is all very rough and ready, so please do not try and break it because you will.<br>
<br>
The code is development code for the new version of Repton Map Creator, and has been made publically available for public testing and reporting of any issues.<br>
<br>
Files are loaded by dragging them onto the panel above the editing area. Only file checks done are to see if the filename starts with 'O.' (BBC Object file), 'eO.' (Electron Object file), 'T.' (BBC Tokenised file), or 'eT.' (Electron Tokenised file).<br>
<br>
Please report any problems the usual ways: either by raising an issue, via StarDot, or by emailing me (if you have my email address, of course).
